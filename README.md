# Learning Python in Public

I'm relearning to code. This repository documents my progress as I build the technical skills for **Clairevoyant Labs**—the innovation pillar of my business, Saint Clairevoyant.

## Why Python?

I taught myself HTML, CSS, and FTP at 11 years old during the Web 1.0 era. I've been comfortable in the Linux command line since learning it during the pandemic with Zed Shaw's Command Line Crash Course. Now I'm circling back to formal programming to build tools that honor the work I do: rare book dealing, archival research, and provenance documentation.

## My Approach

I'm using two resources with different teaching philosophies:

**Learn Python 3 the Hard Way (Zed Shaw)**  
For when I'm motivated and want active momentum. His drill-sergeant style reminds me of how I learned originally—just figuring it out by doing it. No hand-holding.

**Introduction to Python Programming (OpenStax)**  
For when I need structured thinking and want to decompress. The academic framework helps me organize what I'm learning into something professional-grade.

## Current Goal

My primary project is building a digital tribute to a UW Archivist whose estate I acquired. He had no children, and his collection shows someone who deeply appreciated life and preservation. I want to create something that honors his legacy—with his extended family's permission—once I know enough to do it justice.

## Progress Log

| Milestone | Status | Notes |

| Git workflow | ✅ | Credential helper configured, pushing via CLI |
| Python fundamentals | 🟡 | Working through `print()`, variables, basic I/O |
| Archivist tribute project | ⚪ | Planning phase |

This is accountability work. I've been a solo learner since childhood, and making this public keeps me honest about follow-through.
