# 🏛️ The Antiquarian’s Lab: A Python Journey
### Art. Science. Provenance.

> "The ability to 'see' the extraordinary in the mundane—and the technical precision to prove it."

Welcome to the digital workshop of **Saint Clairevoyant**. This repository serves as a "Learning in Public" record of my transition from a Web 1.0 "solo flyer" to a modern developer of archival infrastructure. 

## 🕯️ The Vision: Ancient Utility
I am building the technical foundation for **Clairevoyant Labs**. My goal is to marry the "Eye" of an antiquarian with the rigor of algorithmic thinking. Whether it is a 1826 Chiswick Press Shakespeare set or a lost archive of board meeting notes, I am learning to quantify the "Special" through code.

## 📖 The Curriculum: Active Fire & Structured Calm
I operate at 100+ WPM and prefer the raw command line (Linux/Penguin) over polished GUIs. To master Python, I am balancing two distinct learning styles:

* **The Hard Way (Zed Shaw):** Reconnecting with my roots. This is about discipline, muscle memory, and the "grit" of the command line—the same way I taught myself FTP and CSS at 11 years old.
* **The Structured Logic (OpenStax):** The academic "decompression." This provides the theoretical framework to organize the fire of the exercises into a professional-grade methodology.

## 🏹 The North Star: The Archivist's Tribute
The ultimate goal of this technical evolution is to build a digital monument. I am currently working toward a project that honors the legacy of a UW Archivist whose estate I’ve been entrusted with. This will be a "proof of work" for his life’s appreciation—built with the very tools I am honing here.

## 📊 The Logbook
| Milestone | Status | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linux Environment Setup** | ✅ Complete | Navigated SSL certificate errors on ChromeOS; the "Hard Way" begins. |
| **Python Fundamentals** | 🟡 In Progress | Mastering `print()`, `sep`, and `end` for future metadata formatting. |
| **The Tribute Project** | ⚪ Planned | Permission/Design phase with extended family. |
