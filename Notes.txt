LEFT OFF ON: pg 42/328 (using top page navigation part)

First Parts
- rev'd how to create & then change into a directory; make new file (this one), etc.


Finding things on the internet:
- instruction: search online for the python list funcitons

First program: variation on hello world; mulstiple lines
run it by typing "python3 followed by name of the program file ie "ex1.py"
add a line,
Hash out all but 1 line, etc

Comments/Pound Characters/Hashing out lines
- comments are very important
- they tell you, in egnlish, what something does
- they can also disable parts of your program if you need them temporarily removed (ie: debugging)

Resuming the tutorial, picking up where I left off on page 42. 

To remind myself going forward, the process is: 

Open the book, to the last page. Read and reviw what you're ABOUT to do. In it's entirety. 

Then, go back to the beginning of where you left off. 

nano a new file (ie: ex3.py) 
When done typing it all in, write it out/save it, and get back to main terminal area
then, simply type in "ex3.py" which should run th python progra right here inside terminal
